#slimCat

slimCat is the most feature complete f-chat client that exists. No really, here's just a short list of the awesome:

* Automatic updating
* Automatic file logging
* Slick, flat, modern theme (which is customizable to taste)
* Roughly a bajillion options
* Full BBCode support
* Automatic reconnecting
* All possible support for commands, even some commands you'll only find in slimCat
* Portable mode, so it can be stuck on a dropbox or thumbdrive and be experienced on the go!
* Native performance and memory use
* Stable
* Integrated profile viewer
* Hide images mode to keep prying eyes in the dark

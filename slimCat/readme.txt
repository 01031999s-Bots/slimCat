slimCat 5.00 dev build
======================

This is an early build of the 5.xx branch. It will exploring how successful the automatic updater built-in is for keeping users up-to-date, and how it may or may not impact development cycles.

slimCat is a 3rd party desktop application for the f-chat protocol. It connects to the same server as webclients, but does so much more, such as saving your logs for you, and automatically reposting your ads.

Installing and Using
====================

Simply extract the contents into any folder. Run slimCat.exe to start the program. slimCat will stick its settings in a special folder on your computer - if you intend to share settings with another computer, or have your logs located on a thumbdrive or dropbox or similar, run the "portable mode" shortcut and then put slimCat where you want your logs and settings to be saved. slimCat will save all logs and settings relative to the .exes instead of in those special folders while running in portable mode.

Upgrading from 4.xx
===================

5.xx marks a new major version, and with it, breaking changes. slimCat now has a different folder structure. Your shortcuts will still work the same, but now sounds and themes are located in /client/sounds and /client/theme, respectively. Do not run client.exe directly.

This means you should probably just delete your old slimCat install and reinstall the theme on top of the 5.xx client folder, if you do not like the default theme.
